<h2>What is contra dance?</h2>
<p>Contra dance is a traditional social dance, originally from New England but now danced all over North America. It is similar to many other dance styles, such as Square Dance or English Country Dance. A caller guides the dancers through a series of figures, while the dancers move up and down the hall dancing with everyone in the hall.</p>

<h2>How much dancing experience do I need?</h2>
<p>None! Contra dance is very beginner friendly. There is no footwork to learn, and all dances are taught just before they are danced. If this this your first time at a contra dance, we recommend that you come to the introdcutory lesson to learn the basics.</p>

<h2>Are children welcome?</h2>
<p>Yes! Children of all ages can dance, but young children who are too old to be carried may prefer running around than dancing, which is fine! Please consider bringing ear protection for very young children.</p>

<h2>What is the music like?</h2>
<p>We always dance to live music played by local musicians or travelling bands. You will hear mostly traditional Québécois, Irish, or New England music played on fiddles, acoustic guitars, and the like. But every band is different!</p>
