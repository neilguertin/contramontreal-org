<p>We generally start booking the fall season in the summer and the winter/spring season in the fall. We are generally dancing 1st Sunday afternoons and 3rd Saturday evenings, but times may vary to avoid conflicts with other events. Our draft schedule on our home page will post each season once tentatively confirmed, and talent will be updated as they are confirmed. If a date you are interested in is TBD, is in a month not yet posted or you are planning or on a tour and would be interested in a date we had not planned for, please reach out.</p>

<h2>Arrival</h2>
<p>Our venue is open to the public well before our dances, and we gain access to the room thirty minutes before the time on our website. Please arrive at that thirty minute prior time for sound check (normally at 2 p.m. Sunday afternoons or 6 p.m. Saturday evenings, but start times may vary so please check the homepage). The caller is expected to teach the introductory lesson at the start time on our homepage, and the band is expected to be done sound check by that time. We appreciate your timely arrival; if there's an emergency or you are running late please [call/email x]. There is usually parking in front of the building on Christophe-Colomb and in the small parking lot off of Christophe-Colomb between the building and adjacent the park, or behind the building off of Everett. The dance will usually go five to ten minutes past the scheduled end time on our homepage (to 5:40 or 9:40 p.m.), for a total playing time of two and a half hours, plus break.</p>

<h2>International talent</h2>
<p>Don't forget your passport. We have welcomed international talent with no issue for years, the border crossing usually takes less than a minute and our friends at the <a href="https://cfmusicians.afm.org/services/performing-in-canada-for-musicians-from-the-usa-and-abroad">Canadian Federation of Musicians have helpful information on work rules</a>. If you don't have the right to work in Canada, you can still perform without filing for anything so long as your tour is less than two weeks. You may be asked to show your letter of engagement at the border, which we will email you. If you want to do a longer tour we suggest researching work permit rules; we cannot help you with that. Please note that decisions are always made at the border, and that a criminal record, including for a DUI, may make you inadmissible, depending on how long ago it was and the result; see the link. If you are returning to the US after and are not a US citizen, please ensure you have the right to re-enter and proper documentation.</p>
